#Recommend double checking all paths and the list of valid disks (called valid_disks) in DISKS_check.py before running this script
#requires password input 3 times if run from node111

#This script locates all .node[0-15] across all nodes and on each node either moves or symbolic links them to a specified disk.
#Cases currently accounted for: both node files missing (breaks with an error messages), one nodes file missing, or both node files present

FILE=3c84b_Aug22_5.node #should be whatever is used to identify files during an 'ls' search
NAME=3c84b_Aug22_5 #full part of the file name preceding the .node
SCAN=_5.node #format _[scan number].node is required
STEM=/mnt/*/gsbuser/EoR #location of files used to identify them during an 'ls' search
DISKOUT=disk3 #disk the files should be linked to
PATHOUT=/mnt/$DISKOUT/gsbuser/EoR #used to double check that all symlinks are present


#list the files at their existing locations and write them into a file to be read by the python script
