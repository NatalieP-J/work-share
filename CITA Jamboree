Title: Interstellar VLBI and Pulsar Scintellometry

Abstract:
VLBI on Earth means a baseline of approximately 6000 km, and the phasing together of data from distanced telescopes allows for much greater resolution than any single telescope alone. However this project hopes to show that this process could be extended to an exponentially larger baseline in the clouds of interstellar medium.
