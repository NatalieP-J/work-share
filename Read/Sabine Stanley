Uranus and Neptune unusal mag fields - electron reflectometer, magnetometer on missions
Mag field of most planets in generated in core, but not those two - water shell
Mercury
effect of surface temperature on core
lack of water => no mantle convection - Venus not cooling fast enough for convection

Exoplanets
Hot Jupiters (magnetic heating), super earths (habitibility, metallic layer created by pressure - pressure on electrons that allow conductivity, mag field linked to life?, composition from atmospheric spectra), water planets (high pressure water - ionic water, plasma water - split protons and electrons)

Interior modelling

detecting mag fields on exos
new direct detection method? - weak fields, other fields drowning out
look for radio emissions from electrons that sprial along mag field lines - strongest for strong field, and lots of particles
LOFAR

Saturn filed is too perfect, dipole completely aligned with rotation axis - Cowlings thm
EM Skin effect

Mars, Rock Magnetization
different dynamo on Mars - strong in South
why Mars lost its atmosphere b/c strong mag field makes it hard to lose atmosphere
Mars crustal dichotomy
rocks cooling - freeze in mag field they cooled in

Earth
magnetic stripes, ocean floor
why reversals?
4BY of mag field
mostly unchanging intensity
solar storms, blowing out power - 30min notice

mostly numerical situations
