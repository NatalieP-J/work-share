Department of Astronomy and Astrophyiscs, theoretical astrophysicist, 2002, birth and death of stars, dynamics of gas motion in star formation
Wide spectrum of things to work on, variety of fields
supernova dymanics, supernova shockwave at surface of star - evolution of spherical explosions, speed of explosion through different media - done ~13 yrs ago, supernova 1998 bw, dim gamma ray burst, relativistic - intial flash
stellar wind?
Now: more extremely assymetrical supernova - external matter collisions
transient surveys?
star accreting onto a black hole - different accretion rates, radiation to gas pressure dominated
gravitational collapses, proto-stellar disks - parameters that produce multiple star systems? instibility in gas cloud
forming stars and environment - acretion disk and jets
influence of existing massive stars on star formation, gas clouds
continued dynamics of massive stars
when forming massive stars: trapped winds, building up pressure - explosion, radiates away
see clouds removed, but as explosively as expected 
radiation pressure import close in
gas emits differnt light depending on what is confining it ratio of photns to gas particles
observing spectra of nebulas
winds are not trapped (do not match emission)
momentum of star light significant
most massive star clusters in MW
using WMAP - ionized gas emission that needs to be removed for CMB
stars responsible for very bright nebulae - star bursts
NGC3603,westerland1
overall: massive stars
influence of massive star clusters on molecular gas - giant expanding shell of gas

SUPERNOVAS
deaths of stars
